A simple adventure game by Oliver Mason based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name the classes).
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: satisfied (5 rooms: main, left, bottom, right, top).
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: satisfied (every room has an exit/return door and another thing to interact with: wizard, cupcake, VHS tape)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: satisfied (all items/text that are included: bathtub= "you", doors tell you where you're going)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: unsatisfied (most objects have some effect. wizard and cupcake add an inventory item, tape triggers an animation)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (tape, fade out on some objects)
